Hey! This is Yaprak!

I'm a freelance frontend developer based in the Netherlands. I work for customers in the day and develop
educative games and programs for my son in the evenings. Programming is my biggest passion and hobby
 but it is not the only one :) I also have other interests such as tango, sourdough bakery, fermented food
    and drinks, drawing, music, singing, cooking, latte art, biking, motorcycles, 3D printers,
    pole dance, building robots and many more...
    
Yes, I don't practice them on a daily basis. I rotate on them. I have a lot to talk about them and
hence I initiated this blog :) I hope you enjoy witnessing the way I explore the world.
