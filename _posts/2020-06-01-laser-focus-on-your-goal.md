I often see people start with a topic but get distracted. Human are curious by nature, and 
the more you focus, the more you discover new things. Learning is endless and if you jump 
to another before you finish one, you will end up too many loose ends. This is overwhelming. 
Define your goal for a certain topic. Keep a laser focus on that. If another idea 
pops up, add that to your todo list and then keep working until you finish it.
Finishing a task makes you feel happy! Now, you are ready to clear out your todo list.
