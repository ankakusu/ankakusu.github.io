It is a beautiful Tuesday for İstanbul. We are experiencing the fresh, warm and sunny days. As being a motorcycle user, I claim that those features are what all people feels when you welcome the spring. However we (the motorcycle community) realize pretty more dimensions of spring.
The wind, smell, nature itself is different with a motorbike.

From a year up to now, we (me, my husband :), and a friend) have been traveling with our motorbikes and exploring nature, villages, village people, natural beauties of Turkey.

We have pretty much to tell, share.

Tune up with my blog to hear about our stories :)

See you at the next post…
